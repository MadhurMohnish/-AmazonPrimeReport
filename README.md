# -Amazon Prime Video Report / Dashboard

This is an Amazon Prime Video Report that has been created using Dataset that has been extracted from 'Kaggle.com'. This Report is Created by keeping the Design and the user interface of the Amazon Prime Video Web App and Android App. The colour Schemes are also well thought. I have tried to replicate the Design Language of Prime Video so closely that you will even notice the similar Corner Rounding in the App as well as this interactive Report.

**Skillset Required to Replicate this Report-**
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Microsoft PowerBi
  - Python (optional for this Report)
  - Basic Designer Perspective (for an eye for Details)

The image that you see below is the main **Home Page** of the Report that I have created. For a Brief Overview, the logo is a PNG Logo from any Random PNG Website Provider. The Dashboard is extremely interactive. Suppose you want to see all the **Data of the R-rated movies**. You just need to **click the "R"** from the Slicer and you will get all the Data related to the Rating of the Movie.
