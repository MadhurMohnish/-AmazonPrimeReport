# -Amazon Prime Video Report / Dashboard

This is an Amazon Prime Video Report that has been created using Dataset that has been extracted from 'Kaggle.com'. This Report is Created by keeping the Design and the user interface of the Amazon Prime Video Web App and Android App. The colour Schemes are also well thought. I have tried to replicate the Design Language of Prime Video so closely that you will even notice the similar Corner Rounding in the App as well as this interactive Report.

**Skillset Required to Replicate this Report-**
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Microsoft PowerBi
  - Python (optional for this Report)
  - Basic Designer Perspective (for an eye for Details)

The image that you see below is the main **Home Page** of the Report that I have created. For a Brief Overview, the logo is a PNG Logo from any Random PNG Website Provider. The Dashboard is extremely interactive. Suppose you want to see all the **Data of the R-rated movies**. You just need to **click the "R"** from the Slicer and you will get all the Data related to the Rating of the Movie.

This section shows the different Ratings of the respective movies and in what numbers. For example: if you see the **'R Rated'** section of movies, you see there are approx 1000 movies on Amazon Prime that are **R Rated**. 

I have used a Stacked Bar chart that is present Default in the Chart Section of the Power Bi. In **"Y-Axis"** we have the show Ratings and in **"X=Axis"**, we have the count of the Shows. Try to use the Amazon Prime Colour Scheme from the UI. Added Corner Roundings in the Bar Chart. Also, there is a partition border added between **Title** and the **Chart**:

This is the most attractive part and personally my favorite one. This I have created by using the Default **Map option in Power Bi**. Drag and Drop the Map option in the Canvas and choose the Country in the **Location** Pane, Do the necessary adjustments and you are good to go.

**Note: Make sure you are connected to the internet as it might face issue to access the map.**
